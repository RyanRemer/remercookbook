Add a little lemon juice over the top or make the Tomato Parmesan Cream Sauce in the following steps.\nRemove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside to rest. Place the skillet back onto the heat and leave any drippings and seasoning in the pan.\nOver medium-low heat, add in the chopped sundried tomatoes, garlic, red pepper flakes, and Italian seasoning. Sauté a few minutes to develop the aromatic flavors in the spices.\nPour in the chicken stock and heavy cream and continue to whisk over the heat for a few minutes to bring it up to temperature. Do not boil.\nOnce the liquid is hot, reduce the heat fully to low. Slowly add in the parmesan cheese and whisk well before adding more. Let the cheese melt and thicken the sauce.\nRemove it from the heat and serve over the top of the sliced chicken. Garnish with basil if desired.",

TIP: If carrots are done before pork, remove from sheet and continue roasting pork.\nWhen pork and carrots have 5 minutes left, melt 1 Tbsp butter in pan used for pork over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and cook until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Stir in bulgogi sauce and 1 Tbsp water. Bring to a simmer, stirring, until warmed through, 2-3 minutes. Turn off heat. TIP: If sauce is too thick, stir in a splash more water.\nThinly slice pork crosswise. Divide rice, pork, and carrots between plates. Drizzle pork with sauce. Sprinkle with scallion greens and sesame seeds. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.",

Starting on low speed, beat until the mixture forms a shaggy dough, then switch to the hook attachment and knead for 4 minutes on medium-low speed. It may look very sticky at first but will come together as it kneads (don't add more flour).\nFlour a work surface. Dump out the dough and sprinkle it lightly with flour, too. Knead once or twice to form a large ball. Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces and form each piece into a ball by rolling the dough between your hands.\nThe dough is still quite sticky at this point, but you can work with it.\nCover and let rise 1 hour.\nUse a rolling pin to roll each dough ball flat to about 1/4” thick, if not slightly thinner. Lightly flour the work surface and dough as needed. Lift the dough off the counter and use your hands to gently pull it into a thinner, slightly oblong shape. Let it rest 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, preheat a cast iron pan for 5 minutes on medium-high heat. You’ll know it’s hot enough when you sprinkle it with water and it beads and evaporates immediately.\nAdd one naan to the pan. Cover the pan and cook until bubbles start to grow on the top of the naan (about 30-60 seconds).\nFlip and cook on the other side until the dough loses its shiny, raw look and starts charring in spots (about 30 seconds more). For more dramatic puffing up and charring (like authentic tandoori-style naan), see notes below for instructions on finishing the naan over a direct flame.\nAs naan breads are cooked, transfer them to a plate and cover with a towel to keep warm.\nMelt the butter and stir in cilantro, if using. Immediately brush the butter over warm naan (this seals the moisture into the hot bread and ensures softness).",

Pour the mixture into 4 oz ramekins and transfer to the fridge. Allow the budinos to set in the fridge for 2-3 hours.\nSalted Caramel: In a pan or pot over medium heat, add the sugar. Once it starts to melt, stir it with a rubber spatula. It will start to get clumpy and look like the texture of wet sand, this is fine, keep stirring as the sugar melts.\nOnce the sugar has melted, is smooth, and dark in color, stir in the cubed butter. It will foam and bubble a lot, but keep stirring until the butter is completely melted.\nTurn the heat off and stir in the heavy cream until the caramel is smooth. Add salt to taste, then jar and use or store in the refrigerator.\nRemove budinos from the fridge, serve it topped with homemade salted caramel, and whipped cream!",

Set aside.\nMake the crust: Mix the melted butter, 1/2 cup of sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add 2 cups and 2 Tablespoons of flour and stir to completely combine. The dough will be thick. Press firmly into prepared pan, making sure the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned.\nRemove from the oven. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the warm crust (not all the way through the crust). A new step I swear by, this helps the filling stick and holds the crust in place. Set aside until step 5.\nMake the filling: Sift the remaining sugar and flour together in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs, then the lemon juice until completely combined.\nPour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and no longer jiggles. (Give the pan a light tap with an oven mitt to test.) Remove bars from the oven and cool completely at room temperature. I usually cool them for about 2 hours at room temperature, then stick in the refrigerator for 1-2 more hours until pretty chilled. I recommend serving chilled.\nOnce cool, lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides. Dust with confectioners' sugar and cut into squares before serving. For neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut. Cover and store leftover lemon bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.",

Then, place the salmon in the bowl with the marinade, skin side up if applicable.\nSpoon the marinade on top of the salmon, making sure to coat the sides and skin. Cover and keep it in the refrigerator for 1–2 hours max.\nNext, take the salmon out of the refrigerator and remove any excess marinade; otherwise, the miso may burn.\nGenerously spray the inside of the air fryer with cooking spray or grease it with oiled parchment paper to prevent sticking. Place the salmon bites in the air fryer basket, skin side up if applicable. Spray the top of the salmon bites with oil until lightly covered. Set your air fryer to 400°F and cook for 8 minutes or until caramelized on the outside.\nTake it out of the air fryer and test if the salmon is cooked by flaking the flesh. If it flakes easily, it’s cooked through. Optionally, you can broil the salmon to give it a nice char, if desired. Simply remove a few minutes early and broil in the oven until desired char is reached and internal temp reaches 145F.\nServe: Sprinkle salmon bites with sesame seeds and thinly sliced green onions. Serve over rice with steamed veggies.",

You want to be able to achieve an even, fairly thin layer of chocolate on the shortbread.\nTransfer the melted chocolate into a narrow glass or other narrow container that will give you a deep layer of chocolate (you want to be able to dip at least half of a cookie stick into chocolate).\nDip the cookie sticks into the melted chocolate. After dipping, gently shake them to help any excess chocolate to drip away, then transfer the chocolate-dipped cookie sticks onto a lined baking sheet.\nFor extra decoration, transfer any remaining chocolate into a piping bag (re-melt it if necessary) and use it to pipe zig-zag lines over the chocolate-dipped end of the cookie stick.\nAlternatively, you can also decorate them with sprinkles of choice.",

        "directions": "MAKE THE SOUP JELLY: Into a small pot, combine all the ingredients except the gelatine leaves, and bring to a boil for 8 mins with a lid, just to infuse the aromatics into the liquid.\nIn the meantime soak the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold tap water for 3 mins or until softened like contact lenses, squeeze the excess liquid out and set aside.\nTake the small pot off the heat and add all the gelatine leaves, mix until dissolved then strain into a shallow pasta bowl. When cool enough, place it into the freezer for 30 mins to quickly set up, then leave in the fridge for another 30 mins or until needed. This can be done up to 2 days before.\nMAKE THE WRAPPERS: Grab a large bowl and add flour, oil and salt and add ¾ of the boiled water, leaving a little water behind. Use a chopstick or the back of a wooden spoon to mix everything, then use your hands and create a dough ball. If the dough ball feels dry add some of the remaining water and knead until it is soft and feels like play-dough. It should not be stuck to your fingers, just add more flour if this happens.\nKnead for 2 mins or until smooth, cover in cling film or throw into a sandwich bag, set aside for at least 25 mins. This dough can be made up to 2 nights before.\nMAKE THE DUMPLING FILLING: Grab a large bowl and add all the ingredients into the bowl except for the spring onions and water/chicken stock. Use a fork or chopsticks, to mix in one direction until a big meatball forms.\nAdd the water/chicken stock in 2 parts, mixing in between until the meatball absorbs the liquid, then add the renaming liquid. Finely slice the spring onions and mix just until it is evenly incorporated. Cling film the bowl and leave in the fridge until needed.\nWhen the jelly is fully set, use a knife to score the jelly into small cubes, roughly the size of peas. Then scoop all jelly onto the dumpling filling and use a spatula to mix until the jelly is evenly incorporated into the dumpling filling, cling film and leave in the fridge.\nPrep the steamer basket by cutting a circle of baking paper that fits the bakers, then cut multiple finger-sized holes so that steam can escape, then lightly oil the baking paper and leave inside the steamer basket and set aside.\nCONTINUE MAKING THE WRAPPERS: Roll the dough into a log the width of a round cherry tomato and use scissors to cut into 25 pieces, slightly smaller than the size of a cherry tomato, or 12g each if you want to be exact.\nIn a small pot combine a 1:1 ratio of cornflour and flour and mix with fingers, use this for dusting.\nLightly dust all the pieces of dough and toss with your hands to lightly coat. Turn the pieces of dough upwards so the sticky part is facing you, then use the fattest part of your palm to press down firmly, revealing a coin shape. Repeat for all the dough pieces, then cover with a lightly damp tea towel to prevent them from drying out.\nUsing the dusting flour, roll out each piece of dough, roughly 10 cm in diameter, trying to keep the center of the wrapper a bit thicker than the edges of the wrapper. Lightly dust each side if needed, then place onto a sheet of cling film, and lightly cover with cling film.\nRepeat to all pieces of dough, stacking the wrapper on top of each other, making sure to lightly dust between each wrapper and always covering with the cling film, to prevent it drying out.\nFOLD THE SOUP DUMPLINGS: Place 1 Tbsp of filling in the center of a wrapper and create multiple folds around the filling, making sure to seal it super tight by pinching everything together in the center. Alternatively fold the dumpling like a tortellini, which is very simple. Fold the dumpling in half and seal all the edges like a purse.\nUse your pinky finger to lightly dent the middle of the dumpling and fold the edges together and squeeze to seal, to create a tortellini shape. Place it into the steamer basket. Repeat folding the dumplings as desired, ensuring whatever method you choose, they are tightly sealed and add the dumplings to the steamer basket giving 3 cm space between all the dumplings.\nSTEAM THE DUMPLINGS: Find a saucepan that snugly fits the steamer baskets, and fill the pan ½ way with water. Bring the water to a boil, then add the steamer basket and reduce the heat medium low. Steam for 8 minutes and reveal.\nIn the meantime combine vinegar and thin slices of ginger together for the dipping sauce.\nWhen eating, do not burn your mouth, these are pockets of boiling soup. Place a dumpling onto a spoon, pour a tsp of vinegar, poke or bite a small hole to release the heat, drink the soup to test the temperature, then eat.",

Remove the chicken and place to one side, leaving any excess fat behind.\nAdd the asparagus to the pan and fry for 3-4 minutes until it just begins to soften and take on color (it will continue cooking later). Remove and place in a separate bowl to one side, then lower the heat to medium.\nAdd the pancetta to the pan and fry until it begins to crisp and leak out fat, then add in the shallots and fry until soft and golden. Add the garlic and fry for a minute longer then melt in the butter. Stir in the flour to create a roux, then gradually add in the stock, whisking as you go to prevent lumps forming. Stir in the creme fraiche and tarragon then stir in the chicken alongside any resting juices. Bring to a simmer and stir somewhat frequently for 7-8 minutes until the sauce thickens. Preheat the oven to 400F.\nStir the asparagus through the sauce then pour everything into a baking dish. Leave to cool as you cook the potatoes (next step) until a firm skin forms over the top.\nAdd the diced potato to a large greaseproof baking tray and toss in a light drizzle of oil (~1 tbsp) and 1/2 tsp salt & 1/4 tsp pepper (or to taste). Bake in the oven for 18-20 minutes until they're fork tender, but not overly crispy. Scatter over the filling, closing as many gaps as you can. Sprinkle with parmesan then bake in the oven for 18-20 minutes or until crispy on top with the sauce bubbling around the outside.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nIn a large bowl, beat the softened butter and powdered sugar together until light and fluffy. Mix in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the flour and salt, mixing until just combined. Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each ball slightly with your hand or the bottom of a glass. Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until the edges are just starting to turn golden. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nMake the Caramel Layer: In a small saucepan, melt the caramels and heavy cream over low heat, stirring constantly until smooth. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of caramel onto each cooled cookie, spreading it evenly over the top. Let the caramel set for about 10 minutes.\nMake the Chocolate Layer: In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the milk chocolate chips and vegetable oil. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Spoon or drizzle the melted chocolate over the caramel layer on each cookie.\nAllow the chocolate to set completely before serving.\nThese Twix-inspired cookies have all the layers you love from the candy bar – buttery shortbread, gooey caramel, and a rich chocolate topping!",
